Uh, to be honest, you know, looking there, it just looks like one of those viruses that are going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats.

You know, sometimes these things happen. Um, but it doesn't alter the fact that you do just have a virus, uh, and they are very common. And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. It's unlikely they'll get it, but I can't guarantee it.",therapist_input,,"I've been sat here for half an hour. Do you not want to know a little bit more about it, or?

I talk on the phone quite a lot at work, and I'm just-- I don't think at the moment I'm going to be able to go to work. Can- can I, at least, get a sick note?"

But, you know, if you have just got a sore throat, then there's not much I can do about that. It's just, you know, something that we all get from time to time. Perhaps, what you really need to do is, uh, you know, just take some paracetamol and get some fluids.",therapist_input,,Just- it's just not good enough. I just-- [sighs]

I mean, I could lose my job or something."
