## Problem discussion
Download the AnnoMI dataset, the dataset includes transcripts from
  video demonstrations of high- and low-quality motivational interviewing. The dataset also
  includes annotations from experienced motivational interviewing practitioners.
  Perform analyses to explore 1 or 2 aspects of the dataset. 
  Then, create a text classification
  model that predicts the main_therapist_behaviour label. Evaluate the model that you created. In
  this hypothetical example, the model will be used to characterize the behavior of MI practitioners
  during their clinical sessions.
